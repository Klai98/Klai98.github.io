    <h1>Photography – Capturing Moments</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Photography</strong> is one of my favorite hobbies because it lets me freeze moments in time.
        I enjoy exploring <strong>nature</strong>, experimenting with lighting, and learning new camera techniques.
        It's a relaxing and creative way to express myself and share the world the way I see it.
